# Wolf3D
A way of learning raycasting

## Install
For now, it works on **macOs Sierra**, I didn't tested with other OS yet.

Type the command in shell :
```
$> make
```
It will take some time, it needs to compile the SDL2 Library.

## Usage
### How to run the Wolf3D 

Once the program is compiled, you can show the usage with this command :
```
$> ./wolf3d
```
You can run the game with this command :
```
$> ./wolf3d map.w3d
```

### The map

To run the program, you will need a map **map.w3d**.
A map is designed like this :
```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 0 0 1
1 0 9 0 0 0 1
1 0 0 1 1 0 1
1 0 0 1 0 5 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
#### You must need :
* *1* in every border of the map
* At least one *0*, a empty case
* The map *MUST* be a rectangle
* You can add a spawnpoint with *9*, the player will appear inside
* You can add a finish point with *5*, something will appen if the player go inside

### Controls

Keyboard :
* **W / A / S / D** Move the player in any directions *(Up / Left / Down / Right)*
* **< / > / Pge Up / Pge Down** Move the camera in any directions *(Left / Right / Up / Down)*
* **lShift** Toggle a sprint
* **P** Pause the game, and take control of the mouse
* **F** Toggle fullscreen mode
* **T** Change textures between *Real textures* / *Colors textures*

Mouse :
* You can control the camera with the mouse
* When pause is active, you can resize the game window
